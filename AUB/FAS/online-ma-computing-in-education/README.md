# Online MA in Computing in Education

American University of Beirut · Faculty of Arts and Sciences · 100% online, asynchronous.

Three pages make up the funnel for this program. All three are self-contained
`_dc.html` files carrying the DC template filenames unchanged.

| Page | File | Status | Indexing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cold audience | `Cold_Audience_dc.html` | ✅ built | **`noindex, follow`** |
| In-market hero form | `In-Market_Hero_Form_dc.html` | ✅ built | **`noindex, follow`** |
| Thank you | `Thank_You_dc.html` | ✅ built | **`noindex, follow`** |

All three pages are noindex by client decision — they are paid-traffic only. That is
what makes it safe for the two landing pages to share one FAQ set; see "FAQs".

The three page bodies were drafted against the client-approved Online Education
diploma builds and arrived complete. What this folder adds on top is the repo's
standing head/indexing/tracking block, the decoded image assets, the social share
image, and the QA pass recorded at the bottom of this file.

Since the initial setup the client has asked for several changes, all applied: the cold
hero dropped its form in favour of a full-bleed photo and gained a "See how it works"
secondary CTA, the in-market Opportunity section gained a photo with its copy column
re-aligned to it, and the two landing pages now share one FAQ set with indexing turned
off. See "Cold hero", "In-market Opportunity section", "FAQs" and "Assets".

### Credit maths

The factsheet's curriculum table lists **11 courses plus a capstone project** and
carries **no credit column and no tuition figure**. The pages present the degree as
**30 credits / 9 core courses + project**, treating `EDUC 300` (education) and
`CMPS 302` (computer science) as the two exemptible prerequisites named in the
factsheet's waiver footnote. 12 items × 3 credits = 36; less the two waivable
prerequisites = 30.

**This reconciliation is unconfirmed and it drives the headline price.** If a given
applicant does not have both prerequisites waived, the degree is 36 credits and
$16,200, not 30 credits and $13,500 — and the factsheet says the program is open to
graduates of *any* field, so the un-waived case is not the exception. Confirm the
default credit load with AUB before launch. See "Open client-fill items".

## Head, indexing and tracking

Applied to all three pages, matching the Online Education builds.

| Tag | State |
|---|---|
| `robots` | **All three pages: `noindex, follow`.** Client decision — these are paid-traffic landing pages and are deliberately kept out of the index. `follow` keeps link equity flowing to aub.edu.lb. This is load-bearing: it is the reason the two landing pages may share an FAQ set. If indexing is ever switched back on, the FAQ sets must be split again first. |
| `canonical` | **Commented out.** The live URL is unknown at handoff, and a canonical pointing at a placeholder can misdirect indexing, whereas an absent one is safe — engines self-canonicalise. Uncomment and fill before launch. |
| Favicon | Root-relative paths (`/favicon.ico`, `/favicon-32x32.png`, `/favicon-16x16.png`, `/apple-touch-icon.png`, `/site.webmanifest`) plus `<meta name="theme-color" content="#8B1333">`. Files ship in `assets/favicon/` and must be deployed to the **domain root** — they will not appear in a raw-repo preview from a subfolder, which is expected. |
| Open Graph | `og:type`, `og:site_name`, `og:locale`, `og:title`, `og:description` live on both landing pages. `og:url`, `og:image` and its width/height/alt are **commented out** pending the live URL — a broken `og:image` renders a share as a blank card. The image file itself is supplied. The thank-you page carries no OG tags, matching the diploma build. |
| Twitter card | `summary_large_image`, title and description live; `twitter:image` commented out alongside `og:image`. |
| GTM | **Live.** Stape server-side container `GTM-KZDZDJJ`, loaded first-party from `trk.aub.edu.lb`. Pasted verbatim as supplied by AUB ops — the obfuscated query parameter *is* the container reference and must not be reformatted or re-encoded. |

`og:title` differs between the two landing pages on purpose ("Teach technology.
Design learning." vs "…Apply now.") so the two share cards are distinguishable.

## FAQs

Both landing pages carry the **same seven FAQs**, mirrored in `FAQPage` JSON-LD that
matches the visible copy byte-for-byte.

This is deliberate and it depends on the indexing decision. Duplicate `FAQPage` schema
across two pages splits search signals only when both pages are crawlable — with both
set to `noindex`, there is no signal to split. The client confirmed these pages are
paid-traffic only and are not to be crawled, so the in-market page was aligned to the
cold set rather than kept distinct.

**The two settings are coupled. If `robots` is ever flipped back to `index`, split the
FAQ sets in the same change.** An earlier revision of this build carried seven distinct
in-market questions and can be recovered from git history if that day comes:

```
git log --oneline -- AUB/FAS/online-ma-computing-in-education/In-Market_Hero_Form_dc.html
```

The section headings still differ by page type — "Everything you need to know before you
decide." on cold, "Your questions, answered." on in-market — because those are section
labels, not FAQ content.

## Cold hero

The hero no longer carries a lead form. It is a full-bleed photo with the headline,
description, a single **Speak to an Advisor** CTA and the three-stat strip, and the
eyebrow pill ("Now Enrolling · Fall 2026") is gone.

Consequences worth knowing:

- **The page now has one form, not two.** The advisor section's form is the only one, and
  `#vala-funnel` was moved onto it — the hero form held the page's only DC mount. The
  earlier open question about whether the embed supports two instances is moot.
- **The hero carries two CTAs.** `Speak to an Advisor` (primary, burgundy) scrolls to
  `#form`. **`See how it works`** (secondary, white text with an arrow) is a plain
  in-page anchor to `#how-it-works`, the premise section directly below the hero
  ("You don't need a computer science background."). It is deliberately not a DC
  handler: `html{scroll-behavior:smooth}` already animates an anchor jump, so the link
  needs no JS and still works if the DC runtime never processes the page.
- **Why that anchor.** The client named "The Opportunity — Education and Computer Science
  belong in one degree." as the target, but that section only exists on the **in-market**
  page. They confirmed the cold page's positional equivalent instead: the premise section
  is the first explanatory block below the hero, carries the classroom/MCE photo, and
  makes the same education-plus-computer-science argument.
- **The nav button and sticky bar still resolve to `#form`.**
- **The nav and sticky CTAs still read "Chat to an Advisor".** Left as-is: the skill's
  house style for the cold page is "Chat to an Advisor" throughout, and the variation
  avoids showing one phrase three times in a viewport. Say the word if you want all
  three aligned to "Speak to an Advisor".
- **The scrim is tuned, not eyeballed.** Its gradient stops are anchored in pixels
  rather than percentages, because the copy column is a fixed 680px while a percentage
  gradient tracks the viewport — that mismatch put the copy over the light end of the
  wash at tablet widths. Measured against the lightest pixel under the copy, body text
  lands at 9.3:1 (390px), 7.1:1 (820px) and 5.3:1 (1440px), all clear of the 4.5:1 AA
  floor. It is the lightest wash that holds that margin; anything lighter dipped under
  4.5:1 at desktop, anything heavier buried the photo.

## In-market Opportunity section

The copy column is placed in the **same grid row** as the photo, so their tops align. It
is not nudged down with a margin: the heading runs to two lines at some widths and three
at others, and any fixed offset would drift as it re-wraps. Placement rules apply only
from 900px; below that the grid collapses to a single column and the rules drop out,
giving heading → photo → copy → facts in DOM order with no leftover offset.

Verified: photo top and copy top differ by **0px** at 900, 1024, 1280 and 1440, and the
section stacks cleanly at 390 and 768.

## Assets

Photos are embedded as data URIs for review builds; the decoded originals live in
`assets/` and the `src` values swap to hosted URLs at launch.

Two photos ship as **real files with a responsive `srcset`** rather than data URIs. Their
sources were 2.8MB and 3.4MB PNGs; inlining those would have been the opposite of the
mobile-speed brief, since base64 inflates by a third, cannot be cached separately and
offers no per-width variants. Paths are relative to the HTML file, so they resolve both
in a githack preview and in any deployment that carries `assets/` alongside the page.
Browsers negotiate AVIF first, then WebP, then JPEG.

| File | Size | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `assets/hero-cold-elearning-{800,1600}.{avif,webp,jpg}` | 15–121KB each | Cold page full-bleed hero. Mobile AVIF is **15KB**, down from a 2.8MB source |
| `assets/opportunity-coding-{600,1200}.{avif,webp,jpg}` | 20–148KB each | In-market Opportunity section. Mobile AVIF is **20KB**, down from a 3.4MB source |
| `assets/mce-classroom-robotics-1100x1100.jpg` | 155KB | Cold page premise section — educator and students with robotics kits, MCE badge composited top-right |
| `assets/advisor-mike-220x211.jpg` | 6KB | Cold page advisor portrait |
| `assets/factsheet-cover-300x400.jpg` | 33KB | Thank-you page factsheet thumbnail |
| `assets/og-image-1200x630.jpg` | 97KB | Social share card for both landing pages. Cropped from the classroom photo, framed to keep the MCE badge whole and the students' faces in view |
| `assets/favicon/` | 8 files | Root-deploy favicon set, copied from the Online Education build (same institution) |
| `assets/MA_in_Computing_in_Education_Factsheet_2025.pdf` | 2.8MB | Source factsheet, 2 pages |

### Image slots awaiting real photos

`image-slot` elements are genuine placeholders — they render only inside the DC
preview and are invisible in a raw browser. That is expected, not a bug.

| Slot id | Page | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `hf-hero-bg` | In-market | Hero background photo. The **cold** hero is a real photo now, so this is the last hero placeholder left |
| `cold-fac-1` / `hf-fac-1` | Both | Dr. Hoda Baytiyeh portrait |
| `cold-fac-2` / `hf-fac-2` | Both | Dr. Mahmud Shihab portrait |
| `cold-fac-3` / `hf-fac-3` | Both | Rayan Fayed portrait |
| `cold-fac-4` / `hf-fac-4` | Both | Rana Ghazzi portrait |

## Preview URLs

The repo is public, so `githack` serves these files as real HTML with no token.

**Live on the branch** — re-serves after every push, short cache. Use while reviewing.

| Page | URL |
|---|---|
| Cold audience | `https://raw.githack.com/Think-Orion/landing-pages/claude/aub-fas-ma-computing-education-6bcyjd/AUB/FAS/online-ma-computing-in-education/Cold_Audience_dc.html` |
| In-market | `https://raw.githack.com/Think-Orion/landing-pages/claude/aub-fas-ma-computing-education-6bcyjd/AUB/FAS/online-ma-computing-in-education/In-Market_Hero_Form_dc.html` |
| Thank you | `https://raw.githack.com/Think-Orion/landing-pages/claude/aub-fas-ma-computing-education-6bcyjd/AUB/FAS/online-ma-computing-in-education/Thank_You_dc.html` |

**Pinned to a commit** — immutable and permanently cached, so the page cannot shift
under a reviewer mid-comment. Use when sending to the client. Swap the host and the
branch segment for `rawcdn.githack.com` and the full commit SHA:

```
https://rawcdn.githack.com/Think-Orion/landing-pages/<full-commit-sha>/AUB/FAS/online-ma-computing-in-education/<page>.html
```

Get the SHA with `git rev-parse HEAD`. Deliberately not hardcoded here — a pinned URL
in a file that keeps changing goes stale the moment the next commit lands, and a stale
pinned link is worse than none because it looks current.

### What a githack preview will not show

None of these are bugs — they are all artefacts of serving a DC template file
straight from a repo subfolder rather than from a real deployment.

- **`GTM FIRES ON PREVIEW.`** Verified: all three pages request `trk.aub.edu.lb`
  and push to `dataLayer` on a raw load, because the container `<script>` sits
  inside `<helmet>` and scripts execute wherever they appear in the DOM. Every
  preview view lands in AUB's live Stape container, and thank-you page views may
  register as conversions. Filter internal traffic or review in a context you are
  happy to see in the data.
- **Faculty portraits and the in-market hero background are blank.** They are
  `image-slot` placeholders and `image-slot.js` is not in the repo, so they render
  only inside the DC preview. The cold hero and the in-market Opportunity photos are
  real `<picture>` elements on relative paths, so those **do** render in a preview.
- **Favicons are absent.** The paths are root-relative by design, so `/favicon.ico`
  resolves to githack's root, not the repo subfolder. Verify on a real deployment.
- **`support.js` 404s.** That is the DC preview harness. The standalone script at
  the bottom of each file drives the sticky CTA, both accordion sets, CTA scroll
  and the testimonial slider, so every behaviour is still testable.
- **Social share cards will not render** from a githack URL — `og:image` and
  `og:url` are deliberately commented out pending the live domain.

## Open client-fill items

Each page carries its own `CLIENT-FILL` comment block at the top. Consolidated:

1. **Credit load and total price** — the 30-credit / $13,500 headline assumes both
   prerequisites are waived. Confirm the default. This is the highest-impact open
   item on the build. See "Credit maths".
2. **Corporate group discount** — the cost FAQ on both pages states "corporate
   groups of five or more receive 15 to 20% off". This figure appears in no
   approved source and no client-reviewed material. Confirm or strike it.
3. **Weekly time commitment** — "10 to 15 hours per week" has no approved source;
   the diploma builds never quantified it.
4. **"Only online master's in the region"** — the cold hero's exclusivity claim.
   The factsheet supports "exclusive degree" and "interdisciplinary", not
   regional uniqueness. Confirm it is defensible or soften it.
5. **Live sessions vs asynchronous** — the factsheet's PROGRAM FORMAT strip reads
   "100% online courses | LIVE INTERACTIVE SESSIONS | ASYNCHRONOUS". The pages
   commit to fully asynchronous with no fixed class times, following the factsheet
   prose (which says asynchronous three times) and the approved diploma builds.
   Confirm there are no live obligations.
6. **Prerequisite mapping** — `EDUC 300` and `CMPS 302` named as the two
   exemptible prerequisites. The factsheet's waiver footnote names no courses.
7. **Testimonials** — the cold page's two graduate cards are `[BRACKETED]`
   placeholders with suggested angles. Never publish the placeholders.
8. **Faculty bios** — four named faculty, all bios `[BRACKETED]`. Instructor
   attribution in the cold curriculum cards covers `EDUC 371`–`374` only;
   instructors for the remaining courses and the capstone are outstanding.
9. **Intake** — "Fall 2026" mirrors the approved builds. Confirm the date.
10. **Factsheet download** — the thank-you page's download button is `href="#"`
    pending a hosted URL for the PDF in `assets/`.
11. **Booking link** — the thank-you page points at the Online Education
    Bookings calendar. Confirm the correct calendar for this program and that the
    meeting length matches the "20-minute" wording.
12. **Vala form embed** — the DC runtime mounts `#vala-funnel`. Resolved: the cold
    page has a single form (advisor section) since the hero form was removed, so
    there is one mount and the two-instance question no longer applies.
13. **MoE caveat** — wording mirrors the client-reviewed email sequence. Confirm
    it should appear on paid landing pages.

## QA status

Chromium (Playwright), file:// loads, standalone behaviour script active. Re-run after
the hero, Opportunity-image and FAQ changes.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Render 1440×900 | Pass — `scrollWidth == clientWidth` on all three pages |
| Render 390×844 | Pass — `scrollWidth == clientWidth` on all three pages |
| Every `<img>` decodes | Pass — checked after a full scroll pass so `loading="lazy"` images actually fetch |
| Responsive image negotiation | Pass — Chromium picks `hero-cold-elearning-800.avif` at 390px and `-1600.avif` at 1440px; `opportunity-coding-600.avif` at a 560px column |
| No missing assets | Pass — no failed requests apart from the expected `support.js` / `image-slot.js` |
| Hero copy contrast | Pass — body text ≥ 5.3:1 against the lightest pixel beneath it at 390, 820, 1024 and 1440 (AA floor is 4.5:1) |
| Hero secondary CTA | Pass — renders white, label correct, click lands on `#how-it-works` with the heading clear of the top, arrow nudges on hover, and the primary CTA still reaches `#form`. Checked at 1440 and 390 |
| Opportunity alignment | Pass — photo top and copy top differ by 0px at 900, 1024, 1280 and 1440; stacks in DOM order at 390 and 768 |
| Console / page errors | None |
| HTML tag balance | Balanced on all three pages |
| FAQ JSON-LD ↔ visible copy | 7/7 questions and 7/7 answers match byte-for-byte on both landing pages |
| Cold ↔ in-market FAQ sets | Identical by design, both pages `noindex` |
| FAQ accordions | Expand and collapse, icon rotates, on both pages |
| Curriculum accordions | 10 per page, expand on click |
| Sticky CTA | Hidden over the hero, visible mid-page, hides again at the form — both pages |
| Nav CTA | Brings the form into view on both pages (in-market scrolls up, since its form is in the hero — correct) |
| Testimonial slider | Fits at 1440 with arrows hidden; overflows and scrolls at 390 |
| Thank-you page | Two booking links resolve; one `href="#"` placeholder remains, the factsheet download |

The comparison table is wider than a 390px viewport and scrolls inside its own
`overflow-x` container. That is intended — the page itself does not scroll sideways.

Page heights: cold 8290px desktop / 12585px mobile; in-market 5253 / 7934;
thank you 2085 / 2388.

Known and pre-existing, not introduced here: the top nav is `position:sticky;top:0` but
never pins, because a template wrapper (`<div style="width:100%;background:#fff;
overflow-x:hidden">`) makes itself a scroll container and silently disables sticky on its
descendants. The client-approved diploma build behaves identically. Left alone — the
overflow guard is presumably there to prevent sideways scroll, and the `scroll-margin-top:
80px` on anchor targets gives clean clearance either way.
